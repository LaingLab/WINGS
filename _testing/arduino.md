### Brainstorm

- Device List
- Connect/Disconnect Buttons + State
- Prime/Unprime Buttons + State
- Testing area for different functions (light, triggers)
- Data area for mapping I/O and seeing I/O output

### Stuff

- ArduinoSelect for device list / selecting
- Figure out data/io layers for mapping and getting filtered I/O output
  - Seperate event listeners?
  - Filtering based on string?
  - Whats the best option
- Figure out model for state montioring/management

### TODO
